# TMFL

A (very rudimentary) lap calculator for TMFL, used to calculate the maximum possible amounts of laps per stint, amount of stints/pit stops, remaining tyre% and fuel in tank, as well as approximate time of stint and of entire race; for both an average slow lap and an average fast lap.

Currently looking pretty ugly and the window is pretty big, next update will most likely have a design change, as well as a custom stint builder using the data from the slow and fast laps. Might also make a proper installer and updater or something if I can figure it out to prevent people getting suspicious about downloading and running a bare .exe file.

To run, just extract the folder in the .zip file and run the .exe file inside the folder.
